    <h1 style="text-align:center">Does Music Genre Affect Focus? (Lo-fi vs Hardstyle, Oct 17–20)</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center">
      Different types of music influence people's emotional and cognitive states in different ways.<br>
      Relaxing genres such as <b>Lo-fi</b> tend to improve focus, 
      while energetic genres such as <b>Hardstyle</b> lead to lower focus levels.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center; color:#777; font-size:14px;">
     This visualization extends the original question by introducing mood level represented by bubble size. <br>
     It explores how different music genres influence not only focus but also emotional state.<br>
     when focus is high, does mood tend to drop? <br>
     And when the mood is elevated, could excitement make it harder to stay concentrated?

    <p style="text-align:center; max-width:720px; margin:0 auto; color:#797878;">
      I chose this visualization because, like <b>Plot 1</b>, it maintains a clean and balanced layout, 
      using the <b>four-margin method</b> in D3.js to achieve consistent spacing and alignment. 
      I also implemented both <b>sorting</b> and <b>filtering</b> functions to refine the dataset, 
      ensuring that the plotted relationships remain accurate and focused.  
      <br><br>
      Beyond data structure, this chart integrates <b>interactive hover effects</b> 
      and a continuous <b>transition animation</b> that makes the bubbles and legend gently pulse in color.  
      This rhythmic motion was designed deliberately to echo the theme of <b>music</b>
      allowing feel more alive and conceptually connected to its subject.
