  <h1>Three Visualization Proposals</h1>
  <p>Qing Dan<br>Date: November 9th 2025</p>

  <div class="sketch">
    <h2>Sketch 1: Does Longer Music Listening Reduce Stress (I vs E)?</h2>
    <p><b>Hypothesis:</b> People with introverted (I) personalities tend to experience a stronger stress-reduction effect from longer music listening, compared to extroverted (E) personalities.</p>
    <p>The <b>X-axis</b> represents <b>Listening Duration (minutes)</b>, ranging from 0 to 90.<br>
    The <b>Y-axis</b> represents <b>Perceived Stress (0–5)</b>, where 0 means “almost no stress” and 5 means “very high stress.”</p>
    <p>Each bubble represents the average daily data of one participant:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Color:</b> blue for introverted (I), orange for extroverted (E).</li>
      <li><b>Bubble size:</b> represents <b>Mood (1–5)</b>; larger bubbles indicate a happier mood.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This visualization shows that as listening duration increases, perceived stress tends to decrease. The introverted group (blue) shows a steeper decline, suggesting stronger stress relief from music.</p>

  <h2>Sketch 2: How Do Different Music Genres Affect Focus and Mood?</h2>

  <p><b>Hypothesis:</b> Different types of music influence people's emotional and cognitive states in different ways. 
  Relaxing genres such as Lo-fi or C-Oldies tend to reduce stress and improve both mood and focus, 
  while energetic genres such as Hardstyle or Rap may increase energy but lead to lower focus levels.</p>

  <p><b>Axes (Radar Chart):</b><br>
  - <b>Perceived Stress (0–5):</b> 0 = very low, 5 = very high<br>
  - <b>Mood (0–5):</b> 0 = very negative, 5 = very positive<br>
  - <b>Focus (0–5):</b> 0 = very low, 5 = very high</p>

  <p><b>Units & Ranges:</b> All three variables are measured on a 0–5 scale. 
  The radar chart center represents 0, and the outer edge represents 5.</p>

  <p><b>Categories and Color Encoding:</b><br>
  - Lo-fi: green<br>
  - C-Oldies: pink<br>
  - Rap: orange<br>
  - Hardstyle: blue</p>

  <p><b>How Values Are Calculated:</b> For each genre, all listening sessions labeled with that genre were collected, 
  and the average values of <b>Stress</b>, <b>Mood</b>, and <b>Focus</b> were calculated. 
  These three averages form the three points on the radar chart for that genre, 
  and connecting them creates a closed triangle that represents the overall emotional and cognitive effect of that music type.</p>

<div class="sketch">
  <h2>Sketch 3: Music Listening Hours and Happiness Across Personality Types</h2>

  <p><b>Hypothesis:</b> Different personality types experience happiness from music in different ways. 
  Introverted types (INFP, ISTJ) may listen to music for longer periods, 
  while extroverted types (ENFP, ESTJ) experience shorter but more energetic listening sessions.</p>

  <p><b>Visualization Concept:</b><br>
  - <b>Grid cells:</b> Each small square represents one hour of music listening.<br>
  - <b>Color:</b> Represents the average happiness level (Mood 0–5), using 5 fixed color levels (light / medium / dark).<br>
  - <b>Four hearts:</b> Each heart represents one personality type — INFP, ISTJ, ENFP, and ESTJ.</p>

  <p><b>How Values Are Calculated:</b> For each personality type, all listening records for <b>duration</b> and <b>mood</b> were grouped and averaged. 
  The <b>average listening duration</b> determines the total number of squares (1 square = 1 hour), 
  and the <b>average happiness score (Mood 0–5)</b> corresponds to one of five fixed color categories.</p>

  <p><b>HTML Implementation:</b><br>
  - Each small square is represented by a div element.<br>
  - Each heart shape is constructed using a grid layout where the position of each square follows a predefined heart pattern (array or template).<br>
  - The total number of filled squares corresponds to the <b>average listening duration</b> for that personality type.<br>
  - The <b>color</b> of each filled square depends on the <b>average Mood value</b>: higher mood = darker color.<br>
  - JavaScript dynamically creates and colors these div elements<br>
  - CSS defines the grid structure, square size, spacing, and rounded corners for visual style.</p>

  <h2>References & Inspiration Sources</h2>

  <h3>Sketch 2: Radar Chart (Spider Chart)</h3>
  <p><b>Inspiration Source:</b> 
  <a href="https://d3-graph-gallery.com/spider.html" target="_blank">
  https://d3-graph-gallery.com/spider.html</a></p>

  <p><b>Reason for Choosing:</b> 
  I was inspired by the radar (spider) chart examples on D3 Graph Gallery.  
  This type of visualization clearly presents multiple variables on a single circular grid, 
  which fits my goal of comparing different music genres across three dimensions which are Stress, Mood, and Focus.  
  The balanced structure allows me to visualize both contrasts and overlaps among genres in a visually clear and elegant way.</p>

  <h3>Sketch 3: Pixel Heart Visualization</h3>
  <p><b>Inspiration Source:</b> 
  <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ellen4268/viz/heart_17176865031980/2" target="_blank">
  https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ellen4268/viz/heart_17176865031980/2</a></p>

  <p><b>Reason for Choosing:</b>  
  I was inspired by Ellen Blackburn’s Tableau visualization that uses a pixelated heart composed of small squares.  
  This grid-based structure visually quantifies data — each cell representing a measurable unit
  which perfectly aligns with my idea of using small squares to represent listening hours.  
  Meanwhile, the heart symbol naturally connects to the emotional theme of music and happiness.  
  Since my project explores the relationship between music and mood，which is a topic filled with emotional and subjective meaning,
  the heart shape becomes the most fitting and symbolic way to visualize this connection.</p>
