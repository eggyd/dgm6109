    <h1 style="text-align:center">Does Longer Music Listening Reduce Stress (I vs E)?</h1>
     <p style="text-align:center">
      As listening duration increases, perceived stress tends to decrease.<br>
      Introverted listeners (blue) show a stronger stress-reduction effect compared to extroverted ones (orange).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center; color:#777; font-size:14px;">
  This visualization extends the analysis by introducing a third dimension: 
  bubble size represents stress level, while color distinguishes personality types (I vs E). 
  <br>By combining these variables, the chart explores how personality traits influence emotional responses to longer music exposure.<br><br>

      This visualization represents one of my best works because it demonstrates a significant improvement 
      in both <b>my skill</b> and <b>visual effect</b>. 
      It is the first time I applied the <b>four margin variables </b> in D3.js to control spacing and alignment, 
      which made the entire layout cleaner, more balanced, and easier to read. 
      And I made a <b>soft background rectangle</b> to frame the main chart area, 
      helping to visually separate the data region from the surrounding space 
      and highlight the plotted points. <br>
