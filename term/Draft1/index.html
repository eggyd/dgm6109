            <p style="line-height:1.6;">
            Different personality types may influence both how long people listen to music and how they feel while listening.

        In addition to personality type and listening duration, I also included <strong>mood</strong> as a third data point. 
        I chose to record mood because I believe the act of “choosing” music is influenced by how people feel, and people's emotions 
        are often tied to deeper personality traits. I wanted to see whether introverted and extroverted personalities 
        would show noticeable differences in mood after listening to music.
        <br><br>
        From the visualization results, my data supports my hypothesis about listening duration: 
        <strong>introverted types generally listen to music for longer</strong>, while extroverted types listen for shorter periods. 
        But the mood results didn’t match my expectations. The mood values across different personality types were 
        actually very similar.
        <br><br>
        For the design, I chose a <strong>heart shape</strong> because music feels like an internal, emotional experience to me. 
        It connects to both mood and personality, and a heart is the most direct symbol I could think of to represent that. 
        The grid structure inside the heart also works well for showing units of time, making it easy to compare listening 
        duration across personality types.
        <br><br>
        Right now, my project is still missing a feature: a <strong>hover interaction that shows the music genres</strong> the people was recorded listened to each day. 
        I’m exploring how to add this without making the visualization feel cluttered, and I want the interaction to feel 
        more fun and meaningful. This is the next part I plan to improve.
